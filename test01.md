<p>Thank God, let Shi Heng not be so painful. </p><p>She put the dishes on the table with a smile, He Xuezhu wanted to help but stopped her from reaching out, "It's hot again, mom will do it."</p><p>He Xuezhu has never Having been cared for so carefully, I was a little overwhelmed for a while, and looked at her husband subconsciously. Lin Shiheng patted her hand comfortably: "Mom is right. You are pregnant with a child. It is better to be careful. I'll do it. "</p><p>Speaking, he stood up and went to the kitchen to serve food. Li Chunhua felt more comforted when he saw that he was not only caring about his distressed wife. He was happy or happy, and complained: "Just a few. Mom can't handle the dishes? You can accompany Xuezhu. What can you do for me."</p><p>"Look at what you said, Xuezhu is pregnant with a child now, and mom didn't you also. What about me? I’m not good to you. Who’s good to you." Li Chunhua is not comfortable with such a sentence. The sourness has long disappeared. I went out of the kitchen and looked at He Xuezhu’s face. Intimacy is even more important. </p><p>"Come on, Xuezhu, eat. After the meal, mom will tell you what you need to pay attention to, this pregnant woman."</p><p>Speaking, she went through it in her heart. What happened to the people in the village who lost their children? </p><p>Pregnant women are most afraid of fatigue, fright and poor nutrition. She must take good care of Xuezhu. First of all, she has to keep up with the food. There is also this fright. Li Chunhua thought about it. Zhu is also very courageous and shouldn't be scared by anything. Even if there is something, when he went out before, he was startled by the lunatic who walked over from the village next door, but as long as she, the mother-in-law, stabilized, Xue Zhu I am not afraid. </p><p>To put it an exaggeration, she has nothing to scare her from Li Chunhua's memorial to the present! </p><p>Just thinking about it, Lin Shiheng said: "Mom, you want to tell Xuezhu about this later? Then I will talk about building a house first."</p><p>"I That’s what I think. Let’s buy a new piece of land, build a bigger house, hire more people, and try to build it soon."</p><p>The look on Li Chunhua's face suddenly hesitated:" Buying land again? Do we have enough money?"</p><p>"That's right!" Lin Shiheng clapped his hands: "Look at my brain, I am happy when I come back to see you patronizing, and forget about business."< /p><p>He stood up under Li Chunhua and He Xuezhu’s suspicious eyes and entered the room, took out the big suitcase, and handed it to Li Chunhua: "Here, look, don't be scared."< /p><p>Li Chunhua smiled and glared at her son: "When did you old mother grow up like this... Damn!!!"</p><p>She screamed and looked at He Xuezhu who was looking curiously. She was taken aback, but she was shocked to see her mother-in-law hurriedly hugged her bag. She looked around vigilantly to make sure that there were no outsiders. Then she pulled Shi Heng over and asked in a low voice: "So much money, where are you from Yes?!"</p><p>"Before I asked for leave, I did a task, which was sent to me from above."</p><p>Lin Shiheng looked at it with a smile and was in a trance. She and He Xuezhu patted their breasts| breasts: "Mom, Xuezhu, I will work harder in the future to let you live a good life."</p><p>In a few days, the Lin family bought another one. The news spread throughout the village that a new house was to be built and people were hired. </p><p>The He family was shocked when he heard of the news. He said that Lin Shiheng had collapsed and was going to see a doctor? </p><p>They didn't think that Lin Shiheng would lie to them, after all, ever since He Xuezhu got married, this son-in-law has always said one thing, one thing, two say two, it might not be true if it was Li Chunhua. </p><p>Little brother He is very greedy for this money. Why didn’t he expect to make money as a soldier before, thinking that every time he wanted to play poker with his buddies, he had no money, so he immediately asked his mother to go to Lin’s house to borrow money. </p><p>The mother and son went again, and this time they showed their sincerity, and they also offered a door-to-door gift. </p><p>As soon as He passed by, she heard about her daughter’s pregnancy. She smiled on her face and said, "This is a good thing, Xuezhu, you must be a big belly. Fat boy!"</p><p>He Xuezhu touched his stomach and whispered: "Mother, don't say that, the child has not been born yet."</p><p>"It's okay, you eat more sour Don’t touch the hot ones, the hot and sour girls, don’t give birth to a girl."</p><p>Li Chunhua was opening the curtain and coming in, and she agreed with this sentence. Yes, you can’t have a son. ! </p><p>But as soon as she raised her eyes, she saw her son's ugly face and his slightly clenched hands at the corner of the table. </p><p>Others didn't pay attention, and the mother saw it clearly. </p><p>She immediately cleared her mind. </p><p>Yes! Shi Heng can't give birth! </p><p>Who can tell the gender of this child? If the son is okay, if the daughter is all about wanting grandchildren, wouldn’t it make Shi Heng feel uncomfortable! </p><p>Li Chunhua immediately pressed her face down and walked in with a gloomy face. </p><p>"Who is the girl! I am Li Chunhua the kind of patriarchal person?! As long as it is my Lin family's baby, I love both boys and girls!"</p>< p>"It's not that I said, my mother in law, your feudal ideology is really amazing, don't say such things in the future, it's shameful!"</p><p>When I was engaged before, I was engaged with Li Chunhua and said "to have a good boy The daughter is useless, they all love the boy and fight for Xuezhu to give birth to a boy for the first time. He mother, who has been enthusiastically discussed about the topic, maintained the posture of nibbling melon seeds, and was stunned. </p><p>This old lady, is she crazy? ? </p> </div>
